Code for message-passing algorithm and Monte Carlo simulation on random networks and real-world networks.

This repository contains:
- 'GC_from_generator.jl': Implementation of the (averaged) message passing algorithm and Monte Carlo simulation on random poisson and scale-free networks.
- 'GC_from_dataset.jl': Implementation of the (averaged) message passing algorithm on real dataset (Friendship networks from the music streaming site Deezer in the countries of Romania, Hungary and Croatia). The original data can be found at \uref{https://github.com/benedekrozemberczki/GEMSEC}{Here}.
